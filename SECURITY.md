## Security Considerations

DRIP is a Bitcoin fork and inherits Bitcoin Core's security model. Key considerations:

- Keep your node software up to date
- Use strong RPC authentication
- Run behind a firewall
- Consider using Tor for privacy
- Never share your wallet private keys

## Acknowledgments

DRIP is based on Bitcoin Core. We thank the Bitcoin Core developers for their work on the original codebase.
